* Scenario 1: Apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.

BEGIN
    FOR customer IN (SELECT CustomerID, Age, LoanInterestRate FROM Customers WHERE Age > 60) LOOP
        UPDATE Customers
        SET LoanInterestRate = LoanInterestRate - 1
        WHERE CustomerID = customer.CustomerID;
    END LOOP;
    COMMIT;
END;

* Scenario 2: Promote customers to VIP status based on their balance.

BEGIN
    FOR customer IN (SELECT CustomerID, Balance FROM Customers WHERE Balance > 10000) LOOP
        UPDATE Customers
        SET IsVIP = TRUE
        WHERE CustomerID = customer.CustomerID;
    END LOOP;
    COMMIT;
END;

* Scenario 3: Send reminders to customers with loans due within the next 30 days

BEGIN
    FOR loan IN (SELECT CustomerID, LoanDueDate FROM Loans WHERE LoanDueDate BETWEEN SYSDATE AND SYSDATE + 30) LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: Your loan is due on ' || loan.LoanDueDate || ' - Customer ID: ' || loan.CustomerID);
    END LOOP;
